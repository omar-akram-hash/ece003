    <p><big>Artificial intelligence (AI) has gradually been making its way into business software and will continue to for the foreseeable future. These intelligent applications have incorporated machine and deep learning algorithms into their everyday functionality to better automate tasks for the user. Automating these processes saves the user time and energy, makes their job simpler, and allows employees to work more efficiently and productively. While there are some that believe AI is out to replace their jobs, they will be pleasantly surprised that, in most cases, this is a false assumption. Instead, the application of AI will simply make their jobs easier. For the developers interested in building their own intelligent applications, the AI platforms, machine learning algorithms, 
    and deep learning libraries and frameworks used to create such functionality are found in the following subcategories.</big></p>
