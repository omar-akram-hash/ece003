        <p><big>While many employees probably interact with intelligent applications, the users of AI software are primarily software engineers who use the tools to build those intelligent applications. It takes a high knowledge of machine learning and software development to fully utilize AI software. There is a significant gap in the need for machine learning developers and the number of qualified candidates. Many larger companies offer high wages to those who can build machine learning algorithms or have the knowledge to train deep learning models.
         Despite the demand and lucrative salaries, there is still a general shortage of those who can take advantage of AI software.
Similarly, there is a shortage in data scientists, another position that may use AI software. 
Data scientists are not necessarily developing intelligent applications, 
but instead using machine learning models to extract actionable insights from data. Most frequently, these employees would take advantage of predictive analytics or natural language processing, among other AI software features, to pull valuable business insights from company data. Many businesses will also pay a large salary for data scientists as their value becomes increasingly higher due to the amount of data companies are consuming.</big></p>
